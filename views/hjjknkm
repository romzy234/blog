							<h2>Joanna Goddard</h3>
							<div class="member-title"><p>Founder & Editor</p></div>
							<div class="member-bio"><p>After growing up in Michigan, Joanna moved to New York City with an English degree and love of magazines. She worked many editorial jobs — and spent an accidental year in law school — and then began writing and editing for publications including <em>Glamour</em> and <em>New York</em>. One of her favorite stories was about <a class="" href="https://nymag.com/fashion/08/spring/44210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Yorkers who wore only one color</a>. She launched Cup of Jo as a weekend hobby, but after a few years, the site grew robust enough to become her full-time job. (<a class="" title="https://repeller.com/cup-of-jo-founder-joanna-goddard-on-career-and-motherhood/" href="https://repeller.com/cup-of-jo-founder-joanna-goddard-on-career-and-motherhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s an interview about blogging as a career.</a>) Cup of Jo is known industry wide for its large and deeply engaged readership. Joanna lives with her husband and <a class="" href="https://cupofjo.com/tag/toby-and-anton-in-conversation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chatty kids</a> in Brooklyn. Email her anytime at <a class="" href="mailto:hello@cupofjo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hello@cupofjo.com</a> or find her on <a class="" href="https://www.instagram.com/cupofjo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>

							<h2>Maureen Heffernan</h3>
							<div class="member-title"><p>Partnerships & Growth Director</p></div>
							<div class="member-bio"><p>Shortly after college, Maureen moved to New York to pursue a career in digital marketing, despite her parents’ skepticism that people would ever “buy stuff on the internet.” Since then she has helped grow online sales at companies like L’Oreal and Madewell. Before joining Cup of Jo, she was driving traffic and maximizing ROI on the performance marketing team at J.Crew. Maureen lives in Seattle with her husband and her cat, Lulu. You can reach out to her for partnership and affiliate opportunities at <a href="mailto:maureen@cupofjo.com">maureen@cupofjo.com</a> or say hello on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtheff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a>.</p>

							<h2>Kimberlee Rhodes</h3>
							<div class="member-title"><p>Associate Editor</p></div>
							<div class="member-bio"><p>Kim has loved sharing stories since childhood, and that has always stayed with her. While working as a receptionist and at a preschool during the day in her twenties, she started <a href="https://www.kimbra.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog</a> at night. Writing quickly became a beloved hobby and one week before her 30th birthday, she moved from Tulsa, Oklahoma, to New York to pursue a career in writing. After a rollercoaster first year in the city, and life as a barista, she had more stories to tell than ever. Kim lives in Brooklyn and still swoons at the sight of the Manhattan skyline.
